# Shepherd's Pie Recipe

**Description:**
A traditional Shepherd's Pie is a comforting British dish made with minced lamb, vegetables, and a creamy layer of mashed potatoes on top. It's baked to a golden perfection and is beloved for its hearty flavors.

**Ingredients:**
- 2 pounds potatoes, peeled and diced
- 1/2 cup milk
- 2 tablespoons butter
- Salt and pepper to taste
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 1 large onion, chopped
- 2 carrots, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 pound ground lamb
- 2 tablespoons tomato paste
- 1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
- 1 cup beef broth
- 1 cup frozen peas

**Instructions:**
1. **Prepare the Potatoes**:
   - Boil the potatoes in salted water until tender.
   - Drain and mash with milk, butter, salt, and pepper. Set aside.

2. **Cook the Filling**:
   - Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion and carrots until they start to soften, about 5 minutes.
   - Add garlic and cook for an additional minute.
   - Increase the heat to medium-high, add the ground lamb, and cook until browned.
   - Stir in tomato paste and Worcestershire sauce.
   - Pour in beef broth and bring to a simmer. Reduce the heat and cook until the mixture thickens slightly, about 10 minutes.
   - Add frozen peas and stir to combine.

3. **Assemble the Shepherd's Pie**:
   - Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).
   - Spoon the lamb mixture into a baking dish. Spread the mashed potatoes over the top, smoothing with a spatula.
   - Drag a fork across the top for texture, which helps it crisp up in the oven.

4. **Bake**:
   - Bake in the preheated oven for 25 to 30 minutes, until the top is golden brown.
   - Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.

**Notes:**
- For a different flavor, you can use minced beef instead of lamb, but traditionally, Shepherd's Pie uses lamb while Cottage Pie uses beef.
